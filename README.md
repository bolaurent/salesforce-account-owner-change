Change owner of Salesforce Account without changing owners of child records

This is a solution to the problem described in Salesforce Idea [Changing Account ownership](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000BqqOAAS). When a user presses "Change" next to Owner on Account, child record owners are also transferred to the new owner (opportunities, contacts, and perhaps a few others).
